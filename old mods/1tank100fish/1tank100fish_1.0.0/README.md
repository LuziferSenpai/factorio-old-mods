# 1tank100fish

This MOD is a joke to the FFF-187, where they sayed: *"Of course we also added support for mods, so you can define what do you get from sending a rocket, and depending on what you put in the rocket - say, if you put a tank into the rocket, you receive 100 raw fish, because that would make perfect sense."*
