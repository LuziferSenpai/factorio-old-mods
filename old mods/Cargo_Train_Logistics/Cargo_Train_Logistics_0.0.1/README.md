# Cargo-Train-Logistics

Hey Guys,

this modification allows you to make trains into internal logistic hubs. You can configure a wagon to request/blacklist items and then based on that the inventory of these wagons will get filled/emptied.

I have a [Discord](https://discord.gg/rVpjuh4) for discussion, etc.
